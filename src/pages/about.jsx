                Iâ€™ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, I learned the multiplication table when I was 4 years old.
                Wrote my first program when I was in 6th grade. Win the first programming competition when I was 14 years old.
                Take part in the national programming competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my 12th birthday, I received a present from my parents - a tablet. I was very happy and already knew that I was going to be a programmer.
                In 2 weeks I learned HTML and CSS and made my first website. Later I started to learn JavaScript and C++ for Olympiads.
                I became the best in my school in programming and I was very proud of that. I was so happy when I was doing programming and I still am.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I become older I started to learn Vue.js and Laravel.
                I made a lot of projects with them. I create sites for my friends and for myself.
                For my team, freelancing, and for my own pleasure.

              </p>

                Today, Iâ€™m the Team Lead and Product designer of the vantazh.com.

              </p>
              <p>
                I am also still learning new technologies and programming languages, to resolve new problems and to make new projects.
                I all time try to make my code better and better. I am very happy when I see that my code is working and doing what I want.
                Iâ€™m always looking for new peoples and project with whom I can work and learn something new. Creating new projects and solving new problems is my passion.
